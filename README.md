# PracticalJavascriptForASPNET
This main project serves to build practical Javascript(jQuery, React, Svelte, etc) example projects for ASP .NET Developers.
# Purpose and Goal
This project exists to go over one of my personal difficulties as a C# developer and well thats the C# communities obsession with using C# in the front end. While razor pages and blazor are indeed very very powerful tools and do indeed serve some great purposes it's still hard for me at least to purely rely on C# in the front end. There are a number of use cases where I as a developer feel good all Javascript and all its variations are far more powerful. 

This project will contain a number of smaller projects that combine C# and Javascript in situations where I believe there is benefit to use both in combination with each other but will focus on places where Javascript is still a more practical use case in my opinion.
